## Bingnan Li

I finished my PhD in University of New South Wales (UNSW Syndey) in Feb 2022. My PhD research topic is short- and long-term behaviour of timber-timber composite (TTC) system. During my study, I colaborated with many well recognized researchers such as A/Prof Hamid Valipour at UNSW Sydney and Dr. Stefania Fortino at VTT Finland.

From May 2021, I joined Digitise Consulting as a Graduate Ditigal Specialist. I was involved in several infrastructure projects in NSW such as M6 Stage 1, Great Western Highway, Mamre Road. In July 2021, I joined WSP in Australia as a Digital Engineer in WSP Digital.

Research interests: Innovative timber structures, Finite element modelling, Digital Engineering, Deep learning
