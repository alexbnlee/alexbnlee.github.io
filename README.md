## Bingnan Li

Final year PhD student in Spatial Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with multiple publications and research experience at leading industry lab (Map Algorithm Strategy Group of [Meituan](https://about.meituan.com/en)), looking for research and/or engineering job opportunities. Here is my [CV](./cv.pdf).

Specialties:
- Geospatial data (satellite and aerial imagery) processing
- Image segmentation and classification through deep learning algorithms
- Social media analysis based on deep learning and natural language processing
- Research and development of GIS/RS applications
- GIS-based software development
- Python, C, C#, R programming

My PhD research topic is deep learning-based spatio-temporal data mining using geospatial data. During my study, I colaborated with many well recognized researchers such as [A/Prof Samsung Lim](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/samsung-lim) at UNSW Sydney and [A/Prof Hai Jiang](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/info/1017/1758.htm) at Tsinghua University.

Research interests: **Semantic segmentation**, **Spatio-temporal data mining**, **Urban computing**, **Deep learning**
